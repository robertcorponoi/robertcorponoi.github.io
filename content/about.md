## Me

I'm Bob Corponoi, a developer based out of the US. I like to tinker with weekend
projects and sometimes I write about them.

## Work

I'm a founding engineer at [CADchat](https://cadchat.com/), a collaborative,
real-time 2D & 3D CAD design review app. We transform design reviews for CAD
teams by centralizing communication in one location that's persisted as long as
you need.

Previously I've worked at an agency, working with the United Nations to
transform education and before that I helped to modernize software used by truck
drivers and dispatchers.

## Open Source

I have some open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/robertcorponoi)
but most are not maintained anymore. The projects that I actively maintain will
be added to this section.

## Contact

The best way to contact me is on
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/robertcorponoi.me).
