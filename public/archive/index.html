                    <p>For one of my tldraw projects I&rsquo;ve been working on, I need to be able to know if
something is under a shape. As someone who dabbles in game development,
naturally I wanted to reach for a raycast so I could send out a ray and see if
any shapes intersected with it. I looked in the tldraw docs and it doesn&rsquo;t seem
like functionality that exists in the base API, which makes sense because tldraw
is not a game engine. So I figure I create it myself, how hard could it be?
Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>

                    <img src="http://localhost:1313/posts/tldoom-shapes//./tldoom-shapes-short.gif" alt="Post cover image" />
                    <p>Ok so we did this before at <a href="./posts/tldoom" >Tldraw - Can It Run Doom?</a> but we
cheated a bit, we just compiled for WebAssembly and placed the canvas Emscripten
created on the tldraw canvas.</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s do it for real. Can tldraw run Doom, but with tldraw shapes to
render the game&rsquo;s pixels.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to have the same setup as the last post. We&rsquo;re starting with the
changes we made to SDL-Doom to get it to compile and Emscripten installed. I&rsquo;ll
only be going over the things that are different between that post and this one.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to learn another language. I tried
<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Duolingo</a>, even with a subscription, and felt it was
too gamified. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I retained much of anything. In reality, I&rsquo;m
sure I probably retained more than I realize but I can&rsquo;t really recall any
particular lesson. I didn&rsquo;t feel like much of the information stuck with me,
other than a few basic words. Near the end I would only log in to get on the
leaderboard.</p>

                    <p>Well yes, yes it can. I&rsquo;m not even sure why I explored this but I did so I might
as well write about it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Check out the next post,
<a href="../tldoom-shapes" >running tldoom with shapes instead of a canvas</a></p>
<p>After some brief research, it looked like compiling SDLDoom to WebAssembly was
going to be the best way to approach this. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SDL</a>, like I was at the beginning, it&rsquo;s a library for
low level access to audio, graphics, and input and it makes Doom easier to
compile and run on modern operating systems.</p>

                    <p>I work with tldraw for my day job. One day, when I was tasked with a myriad of
small bug fixes, I was looking at the tldraw canvas and I was reminded of a game
I used to play back in school,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Rider"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Line Rider</a>. The premise of the game
is that there&rsquo;s an entity on a sled and you have to draw lines for them to sled
on. So I thought, &ldquo;Hey, tldraw is perfect for this&rdquo; which is how this became my
weekend project this weekend.</p>
