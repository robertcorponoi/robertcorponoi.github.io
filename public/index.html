                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to learn another language. I tried
<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Duolingo</a>, even with a subscription, and felt it was
too gamified. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I retained much of anything. In reality, I&rsquo;m
sure I probably retained more than I realize but I can&rsquo;t really recall any
particular lesson. I didn&rsquo;t feel like much of the information stuck with me,
other than a few basic words. Near the end I would only log in to get on the
leaderboard.</p>

                    <p>Well yes, yes it can. I&rsquo;m not even sure why I explored this but I did so I might
as well write about it.</p>
<p>After some brief research, it looked like compiling SDLDoom to WebAssembly was
going to be the best way to approach this. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SDL</a>, like I was at the beginning, it&rsquo;s a library for
low level access to audio, graphics, and input and it makes Doom easier to
compile and run on modern operating systems.</p>

                    <p>I work with tldraw for my day job. One day, when I was tasked with a myriad of
small bug fixes, I was looking at the tldraw canvas and I was reminded of a game
I used to play back in school,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Rider"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Line Rider</a>. The premise of the game
is that there&rsquo;s an entity on a sled and you have to draw lines for them to sled
on. So I thought, &ldquo;Hey, tldraw is perfect for this&rdquo; which is how this became my
weekend project this weekend.</p>
