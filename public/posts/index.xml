      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;trying-to-learn-other-languages&#34;&gt;Trying To Learn Other Languages&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to learn another language. I tried&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.duolingo.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, even with a subscription, and felt it was&#xA;too gamified. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I retained much of anything. In reality, I&amp;rsquo;m&#xA;sure I probably retained more than I realize but I can&amp;rsquo;t really recall any&#xA;particular lesson. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like much of the information stuck with me,&#xA;other than a few basic words. Near the end I would only log in to get on the&#xA;leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tldraw - Can It Run Doom?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well yes, yes it can. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure why I explored this but I did so I might as well write about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-doom-source-code&#34;&gt;The Doom Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After some brief research, it looked like compiling SDLDoom to WebAssembly was going to be the best way to approach this. If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libsdl.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;SDL&lt;/a&gt;, like I was at the beginning, it&amp;rsquo;s a library for low level access to audio, graphics, and input and it makes Doom easier to compile and run on modern operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tldraw Rider - Sled the Slopes Of Your Infinite Canvas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with tldraw for my day job. One day, when I was tasked with a myriad of small bug fixes, I was looking at the tldraw canvas and I was reminded of a game I used to play back in school, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Rider&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Line Rider&lt;/a&gt;. The premise of the game is that there&amp;rsquo;s an entity on a sled and you have to draw lines for them to sled on. So I thought, &amp;ldquo;Hey, tldraw is perfect for this&amp;rdquo; which is how this became my weekend project this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
