      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with tldraw for my day job. One day, when I was tasked with a myriad of small bug fixes, I was looking at the tldraw canvas and I was reminded of a game I used to play back in school, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Rider&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Line Rider&lt;/a&gt;. The premise of the game is that there&amp;rsquo;s an entity on a sled and you have to draw lines for them to sled on. So I thought, &amp;ldquo;Hey, tldraw is perfect for this&amp;rdquo; which is how this became my weekend project this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
